Raspberry Pi based 3DS unbricker

Warning: Even though this tool has successfully fixed a GW/clone bricked 3DS, it's not yet ment for unsupervised enduser use. I (or someone else, it's under the GPL after all) will make it a wee bit more stable in the comming days.


This tool is erotic cartoon ware.

If you like it please send one drawn erotic picture to rpu.bkifft.gbatemp@gmail.com (even if you draw one in paint, everyone likes to draw the cock and balls).

WARNING: Do not run this tool with a kernel that has the MMC/SD subsystem enabled!

Requirements: 

-Raspberry Pi running from USB with a kernel without MMC/SD drivers.

-3DS (at least) 4 wire NAND -> SD hardware mod.

-NAND backup of said 3DS



Boot the Pi, plug the 4 wire mod SD adapter in the Pi's SD slot, run the program.
It will erase the NAND and remove the lock, so it can be reflashed using a SD2USB adapter.
